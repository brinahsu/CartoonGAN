The goal of this project is to convert videos to animations. Our motivation is to generate anime scenes by neural network automatically. In this way, the workload of animators can be reduced. Furthermore, it has the potential to be integrated with metaverse. We can easily transfer any real world building or scenes to the world of metaverse.
